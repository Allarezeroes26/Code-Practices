Power Cleaner Bot

Your robot doesn’t just clean — it also tracks battery power and cleaning efficiency.
Each room cleaned reduces the battery by 15%, and the robot can only clean while the battery is above 0%.
When the battery runs low, it recharges to full (100%).

Requirements:
Use a while loop to keep cleaning until all rooms (e.g. 5) are done.
Subtract 15 from battery power each time.
When the battery is ≤ 0, print “Recharging…”, set it back to 100, and continue.
When all rooms are done, print the total battery used.
Concepts: while loops, subtraction, condition-based reset.



Car Race Energy Simulation

You’re simulating a car race.
Each car has fuel, speed, and distance_covered.
Every lap:

The car travels a distance = speed * 2

Fuel decreases by 10

Print the car’s current lap number, distance, and fuel.
When fuel ≤ 0, the car must refuel (add +50 fuel) before continuing.

At the end, print the total distance traveled and number of refuels.

Concepts: multiplication, subtraction, cumulative total, conditional refill.
Goal: Practice numeric state tracking inside a loop.
