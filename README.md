## 1. House Cleaner Bot

Create a program that simulates a robot cleaner doing its job.
Your robot should clean several rooms one by one until everything is spotless.

Each cleaning session should show the robot’s progress (for example, which room it’s cleaning), and once all rooms are done, it should announce that cleaning is complete and stop working.

## 2. Student Study Routine

Imagine a student preparing for exams.
Each day, the student studies several subjects — one by one — before finishing for the day.

Your program should show what the student is studying each day and list all subjects studied. After each day, it should print a summary showing the day’s progress.
The studying continues for multiple days.

## 3. Zoo Animal Routine

Create a program that simulates an animal’s daily life in a zoo.
Every day, the animal performs a list of actions (like eating, walking, and sleeping). The program should print the animal’s full routine for each day, showing what it’s doing at every step.

When the day ends, it should clearly state that the routine for the day is finished before moving on to the next.
Keep the structure easy to follow and realistic.

## 4. Security Guard Simulation

Write a simulation of a security guard patrolling an area.
Each guard checks several locations — like halls, rooms, or vaults — and does this for multiple rounds during their shift.
Your program should display which round the guard is on and which area they’re currently inspecting.
When the last round is done, the program should confirm that the patrol is complete.
